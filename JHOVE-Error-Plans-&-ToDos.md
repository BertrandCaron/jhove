Aims
====

After some discussion and experimentation @pmay and I thought that the Wiki would be best as a source of machine parsable error information. There would then be an automated job that took the errors and created a human-friendly page on the (JHOVE website)[http://jhove.openpreservation.org]. The advantage of the automated task is that it ensures machine parsability and alerts us early if the pages become "malformed". In order for this to work we'd:

 - Restrict editing rights on the Wiki so that only approved contributors could make changes directly to the Wiki.
 - We'd direct external folk to the Issues page if they had corrections or additions and no Wiki edit rights.
 - Invite DIG members to the errors team

ToDo
----
These are the tasks we believe are to do, question mark indicates possible
  - [] Contributor Guidelines for the Wiki error messages.
  - [] GitHub Issues template for Error messages?
  - [] Move all issues from the OPF Wiki page to the new JHOVE Wiki page (automated task).
  - [] Takedown notice on OPF Wiki DIG page and redirect to new Wiki page.
