This is the new home for JHOVE (JSTOR/Harvard Object Validation Environment). JHOVE is software for identifying file formats, validating files, and extracting metadata for specified file formats. It's widely used by libraries and archives. It was originally developed by the Harvard University Library and is now independently maintained.

JHOVE should not be confused with [JHOVE2](http://www.jhove2.org/), a product with similar aims but a completely separate code base. 

JHOVE is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#LGPL).

The [old repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jhove/) is on SourceForge. The [documentation](http://jhove.sourceforge.net/) is still there, and will be till I figure out something better. Code changes will go here, but the documentation may continue to be updated on SourceForge for a while.

The initial plan is to change the build from Ant plus a lot of manual work to a more easily run Maven build.
